Meeding(Intro of Design & project)
* The standard to convert from design to web markup languages:
Korea and abroad has different subject to convert design to web markup page.
Korea has role as publisher, so web markup and script page tend to seperated.
There is not a role as publisher, frontend developer should also know writing markup pages, so seems like markup language go into script together.
It might more easy to reuse when markup language and script language seperated, then can easy to fix and change by developer even newbie.
			
* Current situation
Clients want to see only Web markup pages. They doesn't mind How data need to treat in back-side. 
If the pages written code by 'publisher' their is no questions like Where date would store, or What would be order etc then just finish to make page. More simple.
But as 'Frontend developer' makes components, questions always comes naturally, when api didnt prepare yet.

e.g. Date and Time in webstie
Regist page: Should to input time and date
Summary modify Page: Possible to modify only date
Detail Info modify page: Possible to modify date and time together.
-> In this case What would happen when human modify info in Summary page?


Meeting(Weekly FE developer meeting): 
* If test develop is important?
Its always issue whether make test module. It indeed higer understanding level with right test scenario than just make module.
If developer makes wrong test module? It also indeed right check list for test module.
If developer already trained well what they create, It is getting more trustful application without testmodule as well, then might save time, make suitable schdule with task.
What makes better code and develop team also needs to care level of team, and budget(connected to schedule) for project.
