common component List

- Made by team

- Made by me

* ModalContainer

* TabPanel


As I focus on to make table recently, I used to use CalendarPicker, LegendBar, Selector, table component.

-> CalendarPicker: style1: start date and end date, no background, style2: start date and end date, gray background

It has 2 styles now. I need calendar which only Single date type. need to check If It has option to use only single date.


-> LegendBar: ConvenienceÂ to use. need to study about it.


-> Selector: There are several type of Selector from design. Need to study Select component, check each Select box in design, make clear If I reuse right way.


-> TableIt isnt make to common component yet, It is still in index as raw code, but customized enough to cover table design current project, need to think How I can not duplicate each Table, tr, td. Need to study other component, then I can reduce all same style sheets.

-> Modal: I used Ant Ui Modal library. pretty simple component

-> TabPanel: It need to improve a lot. I am still working on.
