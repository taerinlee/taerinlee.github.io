1. Merge request code review
* Do not use dangerouslySetInnerHTML -> changed to delivery two row by json
* Do not leave console.logs
* Use camelCase for variable name
* Recomend to use clsx( styles.class1, { [styles.conditionalStyle]: true/false } ) insted of Swich
* Save image in public area e.g. 'public/icons/...', and root as ${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/icons/iconName.svg}, make specific name for image
* Using translation function for global teammate: As the project will be delivered as Korean version I confirm to just write in Korean, then share that with the team.

2. Meeting(Status call)
As I got code review from other developer I brought questions to ask
Q. What way is good to make 2 row of column?
A. Make as below
    data: {
      title: '총합계',
      subTitle: 'Net Balance'
    }




After editing some part of the code as above, I confirm the first Merge request, finally I FINISHED the first task from the team.
Next: Need to make the same table a few times more from the original source again to train the advice.
