2. Meeting(Status call)
* Make each feature branch with a jira ticket
* Tracking coding hours
* Task case 1: Use origin components to make new components
	-> If have some questions, If It is not necessary for my result at the moment, leave question list for status call 4PM KST
* Task case 2: Make new compnents for exercise
	-> Asri shared me his own git with sandbox
* When I have reviewd my code, memorise point

3. Meeting(Standup) 
checked my jira ticket with figma. How much difficult It is.
It is simple table, but It is my first coding for type/react/markup for real component, It would takes time.
Thus needs to care example json as well. It seems really way different Korean api json data style. might needs a lot of hands when need to connect real API
